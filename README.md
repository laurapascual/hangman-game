# Hangman game

## Descriptionüìã

This game consists of guessing the word that automatically generates the web page. Hit hits cause the letter to be added in the correct spaces of the word or phrase. Wrong options add pieces to the gallows and hangman. Incorrect letters are displayed in the "failed letters" section.
In the "more options" section you will find the possibility to add the word that you want other people to guess or see the solution of the current word.
